<h3>PHOTOSHOP</h3>
<h1>Digital Art Using the Wacom Cintiq</h1>

<p>
Since I was young, Iâ€™ve had a cognitive habit of imagining abstractions in my environment. Among the most simplistic examples would be to look at a table and then imagine a red apple sitting on top of it. At first glance, this exercise of the imagination may seem arbitrary. Nevertheless, over time it has developed into forming full portraits.<br>
Thus, during my junior year in high school, fueled by the desire to be able to project whatever was in my head onto paper, I set out teach myself digital art.

<h2>My Voice</h2>
<p>Over the past couple of years, my artistic voice has explored many avenues: from digital painting using photoshop to full-scaled murals to wooden sculptures. Aside from a means of direct artistic expression, I've found my style to reflect the abstract nature of MC Escher and the spacious and dreamlike qualities of Salvador Dali.<br>
Through learning HTML, CSS, and JS, I've discovered the constraints of web development to provoke the same flow states I fall into when working on digital art projects. I'm looking forward to growing as a digital artist as well as defining my architectural voice on the internet.
