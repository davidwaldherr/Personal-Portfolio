<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project was to learn the fundamentals of both HTML and CSS, and prior to building this webpage from scratch (TextEdit), I had no experience with either coding language. Nevertheless, the coding architecture this project exposed me to has enamored me with the possibilities of web development. While I learned a lot from this project, I learned more about what I do not know, and I look forward to filling in those gaps in the future.
</p>

<h2 id="start">Start With Why</h2>

<p>
This project was meant to expand my creative imagination in the world of coding and web development. While I mostly work with C++ at university, I feel that my personal expertise will spring from languages that more directly encourage both design and development such as HTML/CSS and eventually Javascript.

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>One of the greatest challenges that I faced was battling perfectionism in exchange for a product that I could ship. I find that I have a habit of taking on ambitious projects, and by breaking the steps down into manageable component parts, I was able to more effectively execute on my plans.<br>

Another challenge that I faced was understanding and implementing the most recent standards into my code. While the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-HTML-CSS-Standards-Based/dp/0596159900/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=head+first+html+and+css&qid=1643057726&sprefix=head+first+%2Caps%2C72&sr=8-1">Head First Textbook</a> was very handy, I stumbled over the old box model, and was unsure which elements were most effective for different development environments. I solved this problem by consulting online resources and planning my HTML before the CSS. By first deciding which layout method was most effective for each major section of my webpage (grid, table, flow), I found that my process significantly increased efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="code">My Code</h2>

<h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Overall, this experience was formidable given that fact that it was my first HTML/CSS project. While I learned a lot about HTML/CSS during the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve learned even more about the horizons of web development, and I look forward to diving into those facets. First, I will read through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-HTML5-Programming-JavaScript/dp/1449390544/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1WD1065VYAJUW&keywords=head+first+html5&qid=1643058144&s=books&sprefix=head+first+html5%2Cstripbooks%2C60&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Head First HTML5</a>. Then I will implement what I've learned into another webpage. Finally, I will learn React and start working with clients.</p>
